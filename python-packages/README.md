# Bundling packages

Why: To be able to harvest the functionalities of a great variety of
Python/Django projects while keeping them tightly integrated and
well-tested.

How: Put a README.package-name.md for packages that need special
explanation, this is mandatory if you need to patch them.

When: TODO - add some words on when and when not to distribute third-party
projects.
